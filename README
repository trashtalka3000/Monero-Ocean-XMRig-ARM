Here I have compiled the XMRig version provided by Monero Ocean. It has been compiled, thus far targeting ARMv8.
In my use case, this was for mining on my phones using Termux. I have used it on a OnePlus 7 Pro and 9 Pro, mileage may vary.

Donations are always welcome and make me very happy(and full üåù)
